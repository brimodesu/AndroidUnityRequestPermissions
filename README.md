# AndroidUnityRequestPermissions

### Simple project about requesting multiple android permssions in a unity app in a single request

In recent updates in the play store, it's needed to explain to the users why do you need the permissions that your app use, before you can use its functionality 

So i created this simple project that creates a pop up that lists the permissions you declared.

Obviously, you need to declare them in the AndroidManifest file

**Example when the app it's opened for the first time**

**Example when a permission was denied and the app is restarted**
